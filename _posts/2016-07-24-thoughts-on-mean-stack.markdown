I personally found that NodeJS and MEAN stack have a steep learning curve and other cons:

- Callbacks hell. Nested JavaScript callbacks make the code hard to read and understand. In a long run, code can be difficult to maintain.
- MEAN stack is relatively new (compared to Java, LAMP,  RoR) so the implementation or core modules are changing. There were a lot of time, I run into missing modules or dependencies. I found myself a lot of time trying to fix them, rather than coding.
- Sometimes the more is not the merrier. There are so many tutorials out there that makes it hard to pick the ONE to follow.  It can be confusing for beginners to get up to speed.
- NoSQL is the default database of choice. This is quite a new concept, dealing with Collections and data schema coming from an SQL background. What if we need a way to quickly visualize the data, we have to find alternate tools to PhPMyAdmin, or MySQL Workbench, etc.

***Solution***
- Try to pick a good learning resource (book, or video tutorial) and stick with it from start to end.
- Try to implement a full stack application with a token based authentication, or a CRUD functionality.

***Conclusion***

While MEAN stack is new kid in the block. It is growing very fast. With the ability to use a single language (Yeah I'm talking about you, JavaScript) on both client and server sides, it is much easier to become a full stack developer.
