Array is perhaps most used data structures because it is so simple and easy to use. Yet its usage and syntax vary from one language to another.

## Java
```
int[] arr1 = new int[size];
int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] arr3 = new int[]{1, 2, 3}
arr2.length //3
```

## JavaScript
```
//use [ ] instead of {} in Java
//JavaScript Array is a special type of objects, is number indexed
var names1 = ["John", "Shelton", "Daro"];
var names2 = new Array("hi", "hello;
names1.length  //3
typeof(names2) //object
//Java does not support associate array (array with named indexes)
//But JavaScript support Object which uses names as indexes
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};
person.firstName //John
```

## PHP
```
$array = ["name" => "rattanak",  "hobby" => "tennis", 7 => "favorite number"];
$array = array("name" => "rattanak",  "hobby" => "tennis");
```
The key can be an integer or a string. The value can be of any type.
PHP can store integer and string keys at the same time as PHP does not differentiate indexed and associative arrays.
The key is optional. If it is not specified, PHP will use the increment of the largest previously used integer (http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php) key.
